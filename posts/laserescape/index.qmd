## wait what are you even saying

[Laser Voltage Probing (LVP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_voltage_prober) is a novel and powerful technique for IC failure analysis. Essentially you shoot a laser at a chip, and the reflection is modulated based on activity on the chip. Based on this modulation, you can do one of two things...

* filter based on frequency to make a heatmap of signals of a certain frequency
* average many (thousands or millions) reflections to "probe" a signal at a point

The laser is different from [laser fault injection](../lfi_mqp/index.qmd) in that it uses a longer wavelength that doesn't induce photocurrents. As well as this works for failure analysis, it has also proven to be just as powerful in [reverse engineering and extracting cryptographic keys](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-53140-2_8). This paper proposes a method to detect these lasers and then do [some evasive maneuvers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0sTNLdNhuE)

My part of the paper was primarily the sensor part. It is based on the 1LUTSensor, a sensor based on the

I decided to make a YouTube video, and this has to be one of the most chaotic videos I ever uploaded.
