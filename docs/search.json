The project was runner up for the ECE department’s provost award and an accompanying video won the ECE department’s MQP video contest.\nRead the report I submitted here"

    "text": "Part 0 - Working around the green box\nTypically for projects on these FPGA development boards, one would use the on-board switches and LEDs to control the FPGA. However, the FPGA being inside the laser microscope enclosure means I can’t touch it, and even if I could touch it, that would mess up the focus and aiming of the laser. I connected an Arduino to the PMOD headers and communicated to from a computer outside the enclosure over UART.\nInitially I used whatever 3.3V Arduino boards I had lying around (such as the ESP32 dev board pictured above), then I modified an Arduino Uno to run on 3.3V by replacing the on-board 5V regulator with a 3.3V one. I would use this setup for basically all future FPGA projects at Vernam Lab, and eventually I designed the PMOD Thingy, a board based on the Arduino Leonardo specifically designed for this purpose."

    "text": "Part 1 - where is the LUT I care about? (Photon Emission)\nFPGAs, such as the Kintex-7, consist of hundreds of thousands of lookup tables (LUTs) for combinational logic and registers for sequential logic, so to find a fault-sensitive spot for a specific register, we need to locate it among the many others. To locate LUTs and registers, I configured them to flip rapidly, which emits a very small but detectable amount of infrared light due to the P-N junctions of the transistors, just like an LED. We can produce a “photon emission” image by placing the FPGA in a very dark box and looking at it with a very sensitive camera."

    "text": "Part 2 - Brute force laser search\nUsing the APIs provided with the AlphaNov laser microscope, I automated a brute force search to determine which spots are sensitive to faults. The process of a) shoot laser, b) check for faults, c) reload bitstream was a lengthy process, but using the photon emission results I was able to narrow down the search area and reduce the time from days (impractical due to focus drift) to tens of minutes. Furthermore, I was able to make a map, such as the one below which shows fault-sensitive locations of eight registers\n\nUsing this map, I was able to introduce a forbidden state transition on a simple finite state machine. This was only possible because states had binary coding, the forbidden transition involved a single bit flip (or as the cool kids would say, the states had a hamming distance of 1). In addition, I helped a few other students at Vernam Lab recreate my results, and they used that knowledge to help them attack secure neural network inference. I was awarded an author credit on their paper - presented at CHES 2024 - for helping helping them out."

Apparently it got a small amount of traction, and I didn’t realize until a fellow PhD student from UMass Amherst I was collaborating with found it on r/FPGA (he thought it was me, but I don’t post on Reddit)."

    "text": "Hi! I am Kyle Mitard. I am a PhD Student at WPI studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. I received my BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering from WPI in 2023, where as part of my Major Qualifying Project (undergraduate capstone for those unfamiliar with WPI lingo) I hacked an FPGA with lasers. This led to me becoming a research assistant at WPI Vernam Lab researching hardware security as a part of the WPI Vernam Lab under Prof. Shahin Tajik and supported by the Draper Scholars Program.\nIn my studies, I explore the security implications of Laser Voltage Probing (LVP), a novel and powerful technique for IC failure analysis. You see, the really goofy thing about failure analysis is that it opens the door to reverse engineering and extracting cryprographic keys, and as a result we need to develop countermeasures. This is especially important in a globalized semiconductor supply chain, where chips are designed in the US, fabricated in Taiwan, and often assembled into devices in China (for a deeper dive I recommend reading Chip War by Chris Miller). I developed one of the first FPGA-based sensors to detect LVP and presented it at the 2024 International Conference for Computer Aided Design (ICCAD) based on sensors used for remote power analysis attacks, and currently I am continuing to refine it.\nI believe in learning through reverse engineering. I have a knack for diving into schematics and poking at circuits with an oscilloscope to debug them, which I’ve honed through my 3 years as a TA for ECE 2010 - WPI’s Intro to Electrical and Computer Engineering course, some of my old breadboarding hobby projects, and a summer internship at CommScope where I performed exhaustive design verification testing on a prototype of their next-gen remote OLT (I’m fairly certain it’s this one). Through those experiences, I’ve learned a thing or two about the design of practical circuits, and I’ve used that knowledge to design some PCBs myself, such as the PMOD Thingy, a repackaged Arduino Leonardo designed to make my research on Digilent FPGAs more streamlined.\nAs a hobby, a bunch of my friends with mechanical engineering degrees are big into combat robotics, and they’ve inspited me to give it a shot as well. I’ve learned a decent amount of mechanical engineering through the trial by fire of building combat robots myself as a hobby, and through that I’ve become reasonably comfortable with SolidWorks and OnShape, as well as learning my way around a 3D printer. I also enjoy video editing as a hobby, and that manifests itself in my YouTube channel, Kyle’s Maybe Electrical Emporium, where I showcase various projects I’ve delved myself into, both to show things to my friends in an entertaining and chaotic manner, but also as somewhat of an “engineering portfolio.”\nThis website is sort of an extension to my YouTube channel. I still want to make videos, but that is a long and involved process that causes many projects to never see the light of day. I am currently in the process of chronicling these projects, as well as giving some extra info about my YouTube video projects that either didn’t make it in the video or happened after the fact.\nWith regards to my YouTube Channel: I am not interested in any sponsorships, brand partnerships, multi-channel networks, or anything analogous to that. Do not contact me about such things."
